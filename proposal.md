- Overall, are you more familiar with Star Wars or Star Trek universe?
- You're stuck on a deserted island, with a TV and only one complete set of movies/TV episodes/books/games to entertain you for the rest of your life.

### Confounding Variables
- What is your age?
- What is your gender?
- Which continent would you identify yourself with?
- What is the main sector of your job/education background?

We decided to incorporate confounding variables gender, age, continent and sector of activity because we want to have information about who answered our survey so we can identify any possible bias in the sample.

## Analysis Strategy


## Aspects of Ethics

After reading the UBC ethics code, we feel that our survey has no sensitive information, and we will not ask any personally identifying questions.  To this end, for age we will have the respondent choose from 10 year ranges.  Because of this, we feel confident enough to use Google forms as a vehicle.  As per UBC policy, we will have a paragraph (copied verbatim from the UBC page) informing the respondent that the information will be stored in a US server subject to homeland security, and have them click to acknowledge this.
